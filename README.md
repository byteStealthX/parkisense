# 🧠 ParkiSense

**ParkiSense** is a next-generation medical-tech web app that predicts early **Parkinson’s disease risk** from **voice recordings**.  
Changes in speech patterns often occur before visible motor symptoms — ParkiSense leverages this insight to help enable early detection and awareness.

> ⚠️ *Disclaimer:* This is a **prototype and research project**, **not a medical diagnostic tool**.  
Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.
